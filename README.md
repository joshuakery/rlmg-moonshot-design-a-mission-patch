# Moonshot Museum Design a Mission Patch Exhibit

This Unity project powers the Design a Mission Patch exhibit at [Moonshot Museum](https://moonshotmuseum.org/) in Pittsburgh, PA, created with [Richard Lewis Media Group](https://www.rlmg.com/).

This is a complete repository of the Unity project. Like all Unity projects, some or much additional work may be involved in getting this to run on a new machine.

For questions or inquiries, please feel free to reach out to me via info on [my portfolio website.](https://joshuakery.com/)
